# About Me / Contact

I’m a software engineer with limited experience in biology and biochemistry. However, I’ve been researching this virus likely to an unhealthy degree for the past few weeks.

I would be happy to help anyone trying to deploy the systems described in any way, including any goverments.

If you’re a news organization, I would love if you linked to this site, and would be happy to answer any questions.

Feel free to contact me with questions, feedback, suggestions, or if you think there’s anything I can do to help fight this pandemic.
