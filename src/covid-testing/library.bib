	abstract = {Interventions in public health crises inevitably give rise to concerns about how the balance between rights concerns and community health security might be handled. During the SARS global health crisis, different jurisdictions struggled simultaneously with similar public health challenges posed by the previously unknown and deadly disease. Yet instead of a convergence of strategies, different jurisdictions responded with measures, especially with regard to the use of quarantine, that revealed a pattern of divergence about how to strike the balance between rights concerns and health security. The origins of this article stem from the realization that Toronto's use of quarantine was far more extensive than that of either Hong Kong or Shanghai, two jurisdictions with historically weak records regarding respect for fundamental rights and civil liberties. Perspectives on the balancing of individual rights and community health security are treated here as expressions of legal consciousness. Instead of assuming a uniform legal consciousness in Toronto, Shanghai, or Hong Kong, this article presents legal consciousness as varied among groups of individuals differently situated in the crisis. The promise of this differentiated approach to legal consciousness is that it facilitates both drawing contrasts between perspectives of differently situated groups within the same city and noting commonalities between similarly situated groups in other cities. Through an examination of three distinct perspectives on rights and quarantine in each city-those of senior public health officials, frontline hospital workers, and contacts of SARS patients-the competing legal meanings and understandings about the tensions between community health security and individual rights during the SARS crisis are identified in a way that enables us to better understand the pattern of different uses of quarantine.},

Due to the system's thermal constant of 0.27 s, we have achieved a heating rate of 175°C s−1 and a cooling rate of −125°C s−1. A PCR sample encapsulated with mineral oil was dispensed onto a glass cover slip placed on the silicon disc. The PCR cycle time was then determined by heat transfer through the glass, which took only 0.5 s. A real-time PCR sample with a volume of 100 nl was tested using a FAM probe. As the single PCR device occupied an area of only a few square millimeters, devices could be combined into a parallel system to increase throughput.},

The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the in-house qPCR were 99.5 \% [95 \% confidence interval (CI): 97.1–100], 95.1 \% (95 \% CI: 89–98.4), 97.4 \% (95 \% CI: 94–99.1) and 99.0 \% (95 \% CI: 94.5–100), respectively.

	abstract = {Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8\%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0\%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8\%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2\%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.},

With RT-PCR as                             reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19                             was assessed. Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the                             dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to                             negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT                             scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more.ResultsOf 1014 patients, 59\% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88\%                             (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in                             suggesting COVID-19 was 97\% (95\%CI, 95-98\%, 580/601 patients) based on                             positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75\%                             (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48\% were considered as                             highly likely cases, with 33\% as probable cases. By analysis of serial                             RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial                             negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 ± 1.5 days; the initial                             positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 ± 2.3 days).                             60\% to 93\% of cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19                             prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. 42\% (24/57)                             cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR                             results turning negative.ConclusionChest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT may                             be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in                             epidemic areas.A translation of this abstract in Farsi is available in the supplement. -                             ترجمه چکیده این مقاله به فارسی، در ضمیمه موجود است.},
