# Google isn't incentivized to help you find information

*Silicon Valley won't fix the Web for us.*


What if you wanted to know

So many companies with private APIs:

- LinkedIn
- Facebook, Instagram
- Carmax
- Every travel booking company
- AirBnB
- Uber
- Lyft


Companies have experienced epic and recordbreaking growth, investment, and market valuations due to the emergence of platforms.

However, platforms inherently have both a limit to scalability and also usage, espacially relating to their usage for finding information.


One way to remedy this problem is a federal data privacy law that would treat certain data/information as a right, and thus require it to be controlled by oneself.

But it could also require all companies using any personal data that the user chooses to be published to be published in an open an Linked Data manner.

This would decentralize the power from these platforms, demonopolize the internet and allow for amazing new opportunities.
