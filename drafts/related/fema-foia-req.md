<!-- the LSCMS as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic on my blog. -->


I request that I be properly classified as a news media requester under 45 CFR 1602.2(k).

I am making this request to write an article about FEMA's logistics software on my blog.
My blog has no advertising and never will, and provides no commercial benefit to me.
The articles I write use "editorial skills" and the can be classified as "information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public," particularly because FEMA is in the news about how it is handling the COVID-19 pandemic, thus information about FEMA's logistics software is of current interest to the public.

Additionally, I request a waiver of fees under 45 CFR 1602.14(g), as information about the LSCMS and its ability to handle disaster situations is of vital importance to the public interest.
