LogVIZ: 
Using a web-based Logistics Visibility Tool (LogVIZ), FEMA is able to 
import from our private sector partners the locations and operating statuses of retail and 
wholesale stores, distribution centers and warehouses. This data helps us make informed 
decisions during response and recovery operations and can also assist FEMA Acquisition in 
identifying local vendor sources to meet disaster resource requirements. This concept is also 
consistent with FEMA doctrine to help restore local economies by buying from the impacted 
community as much as possible. LogVIZ is a real-time tool, providing live updates to relevant data so that operational personnel constantly have access to the latest situational information, and 
it allows us to partner with, rather than compete against, local businesses. We also use 
Interagency Agreements to leverage existing contracts between other federal partners and private 
sector entities to gain contracting efficiencies.
