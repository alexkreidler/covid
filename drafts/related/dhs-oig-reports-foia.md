To Whom It May Concern:

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:

Audit/Inspection Reports and Supporting Documentation
and Report Follow-up Documentation

as defined by NARA Form SF-115, Request for Records Disposition Authority #N1-563-09-010 (available at https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/rcs/schedules/departments/department-of-homeland-security/rg-0563/n1-563-09-010_sf115.pdf)

From the following OIG reports:

OIG-05-36: Emergency Preparedness and Response Could Better Integrate Information Technology with Incident Response and Recovery, September 2005
OIG-08-60: Logistics Information Systems Need to Be Strengthened at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, May 2008
OIG-09-96: FEMA's Sourcing for Disaster Response Goods & Services, August 2009
OIG-11-69: Federal Emergency Management Agency Faces Challenges in Modernizing Information Technology, April 2011
OIG-14-151: FEMA’s Logistics Supply Chain Management System May Not Be Effective During a Catastrophic Disaster, September 2014
OIG-16-10: FEMA Faces Challenges in Managing Information Technology, November 2015
OIG-18-54: Management Alert – Inadequate FEMA Progress in Addressing Open Recommendations from our 2015 Report, “FEMA Faces Challenges in Managing Information Technology” (OIG-16-10), February 2018

The requested records should exist, as the earliest records should be from around September 2005, and the referenced records schedule specifies they should not be destroyed until 15 years later, or September of 2020. Additionally, none of the above fall within the 5 year destruction window for Follow-up documentation for Financial Reports, etc.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

I request that I be properly classified as a news media requester under 6 CFR 5.11(b)(6).

I am making this request to write an article about FEMA's logistics software on my blog. My blog has no advertising and never will, and provides no commercial benefit to me.

The articles I write use "editorial skills" and the can be classified as "information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public," as I believe information about software systems in government is always of interest to the public.

Additionally, I request a waiver of fees under 6 CFR 5.11(k), as information about the LSCMS and its ability to handle disaster situations is of vital importance to the public interest, and I have no commercial interest.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.

Sincerely,

Alex Kreidler
