# COVID-19 Testing

This is a microblog documenting the past two weeks of my research on testing methods for COVID-19.

If you're just getting here, you may want to read [We're doing COVID testing wrong](/posts/doing-it-wrong/), which concisely outlines the main arguments for a new approach to molecular testing for COVID and infectious diseases in general.

From there, you should read the much more in-depth [article](/posts/covid-testing/) that it's based on. You may need some background on the two methods we're comparing before reading, so I refer you to the Wikipedia links in the article for now. I may write a more digestible description of the methods later.
