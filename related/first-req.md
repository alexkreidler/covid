To Whom It May Concern:

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:

TAV Systems Solution Assessment, October 2007
LSCMS Quality Assurance Independent Validation and Verification Functional Test and Evaluation Report; Version 1.4, November 2012
LSCMS Quality Assurance Independent Validation and Verification Performance Test and Evaluation Report Version 1.01, February 2013
LSCMS Quality Assurance Independent Validation and Verification Functional Test and Evaluation Report Version 1.1, May 2013

These documents are confirmed publicly by the DHS OIG's report on FEMA's Logistics Supply Chain Management System (LSCMS), which is available here: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2014/OIG_14-151_Sep14.pdf in Appendix H

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

I request that I be properly classified as a news media requester under 45 CFR 1602.2(k).

I am making this request to write an article about FEMA's logistics software on my blog. My blog has no advertising and never will, and provides no commercial benefit to me.

The articles I write use "editorial skills" and the can be classified as "information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public," particularly because FEMA is in the news about how it is handling the COVID-19 pandemic, thus information about FEMA's logistics software is of current interest to the public.

Additionally, I request a waiver of fees under 45 CFR 1602.14(g), as information about the LSCMS and its ability to handle disaster situations is of vital importance to the public interest, and I have no commercial interest.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.

Sincerely,

Alex Kreidler
